![Architecture Diagram 2](fraud-detector-architecture1.png)
### 1. SFTP Service  
- Fetches transactions from providers via **SFTP**.  
- Configurable to support other retrieval methods.  

### 2. Data Extraction Service  
- Extracts transactions from files.  
- **Open Source**: supports **CSV**.  
- **Commercial**: supports multiple file formats and alternative ingestion technologies.  

### 3. Data Processing Service  
- Processes transactions, flags fraudulent activities, missing data, and other discrepancies.  

### 4. Data Store Service  
- Stores and retrieves transactions.  
- **Open Source**: **PostgreSQL** database.  
- **Pluggable** with minimal code changes.  
- **Commercial**: supports **Redis caching**, **document databases**, and **big-column datastores**.  

### 5. Gateway Service  
- Proxies data store web services.  
- **Open Source**: built on **Spring Cloud Gateway**.
